### Process management
  - Process
    - process descriptor
      - thread_info
        - task_struct
          - pid
          - state
      - max limit of processes
      - current_thread_info()->task;
      - process states
        - task_running
        - task_interruptible
        - task_uninterruptible
        - task_tracked
        - task_stopped
      - processor context
      - process tree
        - parent
        - children
    - process creation
      - fork()
        - create child process as copy with different pid
        - ppid is pid of original process
      - exec()
        - execute new executable
      - copy on write 
        - fork() only has to duplicate parent's page tables
      - fork() internals
        - dup_task_struct()
        - task_uninterruptible (not runnable yet)
        - alloc_pid()
        - copy_process()
      - vfork()
        - = fork(), except parent page table entries are not copied
        - why do we need vfork() ???
    - Threads
      - multiple threads of execution of the same program in a shared memory address space
      - can share open files and other resources
      - enables concurrency and parallelism (in multi-core systems)
      - linux implemntation
        - no concept of thread. thread = standard process
        - thread is a merely process that shares certain resources with other processes
      - creation
        -
